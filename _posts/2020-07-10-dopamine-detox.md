I saw this video on dopamine detox and this seemingly familiar topic, surprisingly, made me think a lot. Here I want to order my thoughts a little. 

To remind, the point is to have short periods in life when you voluntarily don't get any dopamine, which decreases your tolerance to it and makes boring things brighter. Tolerance to dopamine is what stuck in my mind. **If we get used to any amount of dopamine in our lives, why try to increase it at all?** Moreover, having a lot of dopamine in life makes your tolerance high which makes you pretty much addicted to dopamine like to drugs. You will need to have more and more positive things in life just to feel okay, while normal things will make you unhappy, and what to talk about negative things! So you will feel just normal, all while spending lots of time and effort for entertainment, and while being so sensitive to difficulties that the smallest problem could destroy you. 

On the other hand, if you reduce the average level of dopamine in your life and hence your tolerance to it... Not so fast. It's not "*just reduce dopamine haha*" it's a difficult process where you need to fight yourself to avoid any entertainment and any things you like, which is much more difficult and depressing than it sounds. But when your tolerance normalizes... Amazing things happen, you start enjoying very basic daily routines, small rest periods, simple food, weather... You are not a slave of your desires anymore, you don't need to play games all day, or go to a restaurant when just looking at the window and drinking tea without sugar brings you the same emotions. You are not afraid of work and problems because that's what you perceive as normal now. And big problems? Just a little frustrating. You're efficient, you're not spoiled, you enjoy things in their essence and don't react to problems. All with the same level of happiness as before.

Thinking about this brought me to just one question: **"Why temporarily?"** I want to be in that state always. I don't need this dopamine slavery. 

So I want to try to keep it now, although the obvious difficulty with it is that many dopamine sources around us are easy-reachable (e.g. social networks, sugar) and our brain wants them. So it requires making continuous efforts to say "no" for such impulses and assuring yourself that "no, I don't want to do it and be happy now, because I want to be happy in the long term".

Let me know if it makes any sense for you.
