### What God is for me:

* The total energy which drives the Universe. All the physical processes we observe is just the circulation of potential energy into kinetic, and kinetic into potential. Their sum (total amount) stays the same. And this total amount is what drives the world, and without which nothing would exist. This total amount of initial energy is God for me.

* The meaning of being and the ultimate goal. The reason behind the existence of the Universe.

* The parameter which defines why everything is so and not otherwise. The scale.

* From Godel's second incompleteness theorem: the existence of the world cannot be proven within the world, via the methods defined as part of the world. So, in order for the Universe and life around us to be real, and not just our imagination, there should be something outside of it, that can prove it. This something is God.
