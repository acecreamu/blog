Rational behavior is defined and driven by a goal. If there is no such a goal we can't judge rational our actions or not.

P.S. Re-writing it now, in 2020, I actually disagree with it, as rationality for me now is more like logic -- the set of abstract rules which are valid regardless of the setting. Although I understand that in that case, I was thinking more about practical rationality, like, is it rational to buy a Porsche or not? In such a case it's really defined by our goals and whether a given action will bring us closer to the goal.

We always seek the greatest pleasure. When we categorize the behavior as rational (reasons) or sensual (desires) and start acting rational, we just limit the one set of desires (smaller, simpler joys) in favor of others (longer, larger goals). Therefore, all our rationally turns out to be based on larger sensuality and larger desires.

Does it make sense to sacrifice one desires for the sake of others? Is the value of one large goal really greater than the value of hundreds of smaller desires?
