You can't be happy when you work a lot. When you work a lot, obtaining good results is not something positive, it's normal, it's the expected output. However, you may easily fall into a trap when you will not get good results (because of the many reasons, the world is never fair) and in that case, it will be negative for you. i.e. felt like unfair harm. 

Doing nothing, or just with no efforts, on the other hand, will not upset you when you achieve nothing, because that's expected (and also you've spend a good time full of fun while doing it). Whereas getting some nice results will be perceived positively by you, i.e. unfair benefits in your favor.
