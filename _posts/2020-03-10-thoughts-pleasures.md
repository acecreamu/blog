Apart from the separation on high (deep) and low (shallow) pleasures such as literature and say, food, I noticed that I unconsciously separate pleasures on short-term and long-term ones. 

In this way, food, sex, alcohol, or sleep are extremely short since they bring joy only while they last and not long after (up to regretting). Getting an achievement, winning a contest, having shit done, or even working out in a gym, on the contrary, may not be pleasant in the process, but upon completion will uplift our mood for hours if not the days. Particularly hard work for the sake of reaching big goals like getting into top school or desired company is actually pleasant for months after completion. 

One thought I got just during writing is that they have such a long-lasting effect because we actually benefit from them for the exact long period, whichever benefit it is: social status, free time, body shape, or open opportunities. And in many cases our brain can unconsciously estimate that benefit in advance, that's why we are happy right at the moment of reaching it, even before getting any benefit.
