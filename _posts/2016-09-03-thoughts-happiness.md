**The ultimate truth**: happiness does not depend on what is around us.

---

Devices, clothes, cars, fancy houses, are not something what you need. You can feel just fine even without having it. It's all mostly imposed by our surrounding (people who have it and whith whom we compare ourselves) *and* businesses who makes profit from convinsing us that we can't live good without whatever they sell.

How to unsrestand if something is imposed? Important things are important regardless of the era. Naming a few: health, knowledge, inner harmony, self-estim, relations with people around you, humor, *etc*.

It's very important to be able to enjoy the simple things. To feel the joy of speaking to someone, feeling the taste of food, feeling the warm wind, being able to walk, being happy, or sad. To feel the joy of just being. 

We treat it as a routine, although it's not a routine, it's a great gift of the Universe we don't appreciate.

We (me in particular) often can suppress some desires (*aka* control the emotions) in favor of more rational (useful, optimal) things. But why and for what? After all, our level of satisfaction from life, our level of happiness, is formed exactly by emotions and feelings.

But on the other hand, one can be happy from working and being productive and can be sad while following all the desires. 

Should we suppress our desires, or shouldn't we? 

Some ancient dudes considered control over natural desires to be a manifestation of the soul. While the absence of such control and blind following the desires correspond to the absence of it.

I don't choose between what I **have** to do and what I **want** to do. I only choose between shallow and deep desires.
